# For this project, I downloaded This dataset from Meriskill. This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its primary objective is to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset
# Then I created 1 tables to insert data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQLite.
