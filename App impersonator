# I have created a table in this project revealing insights about an App that stores users data such as name, email, phone, country

# The project was written using the Standard SQL dialect and utilized data from the following users datasets (please see queries and explanation below):

/* I CREATED a table that stores data */
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT, phone TEXT);

/* I INSERTED a few example rows in the table*/
INSERT INTO users Values (1,"Juliana Murillo", "jmurillo@gmail.com", "6781234567");
INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, "Carolina Rivera", "crivera@hotmail.com", "7709751339");
INSERT INTO users VALUES (3, "Natalia Mesa", "nmesa@gmail.com", "4049878997");

/* I SELECTED all the columns in each row to see what your table looks */
SELECT * FROM users;

/* I ALTERED the table to add a 'country' column */
ALTER TABLE users ADD country TEXT;

/* I SELECTED all the columns in each row to see what your table looked after */
SELECT * from users;

/* I UPDATED the country column with the corresponding name using the condition ID*/
UPDATE users SET country = "Mexico" where id=1;
UPDATE users SET country = "USA" where id=2;
UPDATE users SET country = "Colombia" where id=3;

/* I SELECTED all the columns in each row to see what your table looked after */
SELECT * FROM users;

/* I INSERTED a new user into the table that has all four attributes filled in */
INSERT INTO users (name, email, phone, country) VALUES ("Andres Torres", "atorres@hotmail.com", "7863458976", "Canada");

/* I SELECTED all the columns in each row to see what your table looked after */
SELECT * FROM users;

/* I DELETED the user condition id = 1*/
DELETE FROM users where id=1;

/* I SELECTED all the columns in each row to see what your table looked after */
SELECT * FROM users;
